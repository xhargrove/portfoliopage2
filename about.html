                <h2>Air Force/Veteran</h2>
                <p>
                    Straight out of high school, I made the decision to enlist in the Air Force, eager to serve my country and seek new challenges. 
                    The choice to join the military was driven by a desire to step outside my comfort zone, develop discipline, and gain valuable skills 
                    that would set the foundation for my future. The experience was transformative, teaching me resilience, teamwork, and the importance 
                    of dedication. It wasn't just about learning to follow orders—it was about becoming a leader, developing a strong work ethic, and 
                    understanding the true meaning of commitment. The camaraderie and structure provided by the Air Force helped shape me into the person 
                    I am today, instilling a sense of pride and responsibility that I carry with me in all my endeavors.

                    Being part of the Air Force straight out of high school was a life-changing experience that opened up a world of opportunities. 
                    The rigorous training and diverse challenges pushed me to grow both mentally and physically. I had the chance to travel, work with 
                    cutting-edge technology, and collaborate with individuals from all walks of life, each with a unique background and set of skills. 
                    This journey not only gave me a clear sense of purpose but also a strong appreciation for the importance of hard work and perseverance. 
                    The Air Force became more than just a career choice—it was a path that allowed me to mature quickly, take on responsibilities, and 
                    build a solid foundation for everything I would pursue in the future.
